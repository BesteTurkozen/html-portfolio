    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>I derive immense pleasure from developing myself 
        through various projectsusing Python. I am venturing 
        beyond the confines of R and SPSS, which Iacquired 
        during my academic years, and endeavoring to perform 
        analyseswith Python. In fact, one could say that I am 
        exploring different programs tofind the most suitable 
        one for myself. Alongside this, I have made a small 
        forayinto HTML and CSS, successfully creating my own 
        website. It is an enjoyablefield, but currently, 
        leveraging my statistical foundation, I am striving toenhance my skills in the realm of machine learning.</p>
